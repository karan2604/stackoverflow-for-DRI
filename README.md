Here, we would start with one prominent ICM Alert from Azure ServiceBus/EventHub Service and extract raw content from the existing ICM page. ICM content would then flow through Azure OpenAI to get a summary (alert patterns and mitigation steps) which would be posted as an answer against that ICM related question on stackoverflow .
